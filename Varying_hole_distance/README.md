The project aimed to expand the knowledge of the Blind Hole Method 
(MFC), by numerical analysis of the influence of the distance between holes on 
on the stresses identified at the hole border. Numerical 
numerical simulations were performed in order to predict variations in the stresses around 
the hole as a function of the distance between the holes. The influence of the distance 
was evaluated with the aid of Ansys Mechanical APDL® and Matlab® software. 
For this, it was developed a parameterized numerical model in 
APDL language in order to enable the variation of the geometry and verify the 
influence.
To make the analysis more robust and, at the same time, to enable 
comparison with models already developed, the following geometries were 
case with through hole, thin case with blind hole, and thick case with blind hole. 
case with blind hole. In this way, the results obtained for the through hole 
through hole case could be compared with data found in the literature for 
the distance between holes in thin slabs. On the other hand, the values presented for the 
thick case, a condition widely used by CBM researchers, 
could be obtained and compared with the results obtained for the case of through hole in thin plate.

The theme of the project is related to the continuity of research activities 
activities in the area of Modeling and Simulation developed at LMP/UFSC and 
at Labmetro/UFSC. The activities developed from the partnership between 
these laboratories are focused on the optimization of the residual stress measurement equipment 
residual stresses and the measurement process.
