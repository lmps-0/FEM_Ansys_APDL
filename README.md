# The Finite Element Analysis

The finite element method (FEM) or Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical method widely used in many fields of study to find approximate solutions to real problems by solving (partial) differential equations. 

In a generic way, the method consists of partitioning the domain of the unknown function, associating shape functions to the partitions, which by combining them with the unknowns of the physical problem constitute an approximate solution of the desired physical quantity. FEM was first developed to solve problems related to structural analysis and then gained space in other research fields. 
It is commonly used to solve problems that do not have a direct analytical solution. 

A finite element analysis (FEA) can be subdivided into four main steps:
1. The discretization  of the continuum by dividing the domain into subdomains or finite elements, which requires the definition of the element shape, 
number of nodes and the interpolation function (shape function).
2. The determination of the element equations that describe the relationship between the relationship between the primary unknowns, such as the displacement, and the secondary 
secondary unknowns, such as stress and strain.
3. Combining the element equations into a global matrix, taking into account the boundary and loading conditions.
4. The solution of the system of equations to obtain the results of the numerical simulation results.
